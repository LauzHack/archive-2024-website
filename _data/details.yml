    You will get 24 hours to build your hack, optionally inspired by our sponsors' challenges.
    You can be in a team of up to 4, there will be a team-building opportunity before hacking.  
    After hacking is over, there will be one global ranking from our jury, and one per sponsor challenge.  
    We also have some fun workshops and games, with small prizes!

    Prizes will be awarded in the global ranking based on (1) how innovative, original, and unexpected your project is;  
    (2) how convincing your demo is, no slides allowed; and  
    (3) how impressive your hack is in terms of "wow" factor and technology.  
    There will also be prizes for sponsor challenges, according to each sponsor's criteria.  
    _As per our rules, you are encouraged to use existing libraries and APIs, you may even use existing code you wrote,_  
    _but you must clearly state which parts of your project are novel and which parts you reused._
