    **Design the future of sales forecast trending**
    If you are interested in predictive modelling and sales forecasting, we have a great opportunity for you.
    Bristol-Myers Squibb, one of the top 10 pharmaceutical company in the world, is looking at enhancing its trending model to gain in forecast accuracy and be able to predict the impact of future events. Overall, the challenge is to develop a multivariate time series forecast model. Improved sales forecasting is critical and will help Bristol-Myers Squibb to make better decisions to support its investments and overall strategy to transform patientsâ€™ lives through science.

  text: "By adopting Building Information Modeling (BIM), SBB brings infrastructure planning to a digital 3D and object-oriented world, enhances collaboration and ensures a future-ready data-driven approach to infrastructure management. However, to start planning, the existing infrastructure at the construction site must already be captured as a BIM-model and structured according to our new data structure. 


    Over the years, we have accumulated diverse inventory data across various systems, but the sheer volume and diversity of our data make manual transformation into the new format impractical. We are therefore looking for innovative solutions to automate this mapping process and thus to facilitate the semi-automatic creation of inventory models."

    Imagine trying to find a needle in a haystack&minus;only this haystack is made up of millions of transactions happening daily. Somewhere in this massive web are transactions between our customers and external parties that, on the surface, seem disconnected but are in fact intricately linked, hidden by variations in names and addresses. 
    Your challenge: create a powerful tool that uncover hidden connections! You can use NLP, graph techniques or any other innovative approach to make sense of the chaos and help us keep financial data secure. Ready to uncover the needles in our data?

  text: "Images and the contents of images can provide vital insight into the current state of a physical system or environment; or a change to this over time. Recent advantages in both LLMs and segmentation models make exploring this space even more interesting, and we are keen to understand what the current &lsquo;state of the art&rsquo; makes possible.  
        We are looking for the best implementation of using linguistic prompts to allow the interrogation of images or video, (i.e. an LLM interface for image/video analysis). The exact use case that participants pick is up to them, but we will have some guiding topics and data sources relevant to Vitol to inspire them."
